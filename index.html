                <p>Chadwick Boseman.[Shows smiling image of him], A man. A great man. While he struggled with cancer, he partook in great works that deserve to be remembered.
                    So great a boy somewhere looked to the sky and said, "Chadwick, you will be remembered, I'll make sure of it"- The Olaolu Promise. Then he pulled his buddies together and started building a site to collect scattered tributes into one place so future generations can remember the impact great lives like Chadwick Boseman had on others when they lived.
                     The Olaolu Promise is now to be available for any person that is great to you, who impacted your life. For free, we can keep their memory in a place where it will be shown to future generationsâ€¦</p>
